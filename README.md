# Predicting Website Churn Through Seasonal Time Series Decomposition of Traffic

## Overview

This project analyzes website traffic data to identify seasonal patterns in user churn (website abandonment).  By decomposing the time series of website traffic into its constituent components (trend, seasonality, and residuals), we aim to predict future periods of high churn and inform proactive retention strategies.  The analysis utilizes statistical time series methods to identify significant seasonal effects and forecast future traffic trends.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Statsmodels
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Ensure that your data file (e.g., `website_traffic.csv`) is located in the same directory as `main.py`.  The format of the data file should be specified within the script (likely a CSV with a date column and a traffic volume column).


## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including:

* Summary statistics of the website traffic data.
* Details of the seasonal decomposition (trend, seasonal, and residual components).
* Model evaluation metrics (if a forecasting model is used).
* Predictions of future website traffic and churn.

Additionally, the script will generate several plot files (e.g., `traffic_decomposition.png`, `forecast_plot.png`) visualizing the time series data, its decomposition, and the forecast.  These files will be saved in the project directory.  The specific plots generated may vary based on the analysis performed.
